I was dx in 2014 with MS after optic neuritis and tingling in my right hand and arm so muddled by with lyrica and steroids etc then four months ago both my feet lost feeling like I'm walking on cotton wool it then progressed to both legs I understand this is not usual for MS (having identical symptoms on both sides of the body) anyone have any ideas? Without being too crass my feminine workings are also now losing feeling I am going back to neurologist but now am using crutches and seem to have a serious intolerance to hot water I am wondering if I've been diagnosed incorrectly?
It sounds like you may be experiencing a relapse? Perhaps your neurologist will recommend another MRI to see if any brain or spinal lesions have changed or grown or if you have new ones. Are you seeing a neurologist that specializes in Ms? For my reading and research it sounds like that makes a world of difference! Good luck! Hope you feel better soon.
Originally neurologist thought it was relapse but I'm having more tests as my symptoms are unusual for MS (identical symptoms on both sides) it's more usual for that to happen with Primary Progressive my neurologist is excellent so I'm sure I will get some answers - thank you for your reply!
Have b6 checked and check all vitamins for it. Too much b6 can cause lots of neurological issues.
"I have tested very high b6 twice over the past year. I have twitching and tingling in the lower legs and upper back. I'm always interested when someone posts a reply like you have.Do you know of a way to reduce the levels of vit b6 in my body?"
 have heard this before with B6 when I was tested my B12 was causing some issues and I now get B12 injections but I'm not sure how to reduce levels of B6
"The only two ways without stopping supplementation, as that it usually the cause, is i know increasing protein and increasing b1. B1 has an inverse relationship to b6. If you were to do that, I would have labs drawn frequently to monitor. You don't want to throw off a bunch of vitamins you know. Protein has a direct relationship. The more protein, the more b6 is needed because b6 binds to protein. So in a study on cats for example, I think it was cats, when they tripled their protein, their b6 fell and they required 3x as much b6 as well to keep it from falling. You could try it. I had b6 toxicity from supplements so when I stopped, it went back to normal, but I know that's not the case with everyone and it mimics MS. B6 is nasty nasty nasty stuff and high levels show toxicity."
I have never been the same since I took that stupid vitamin.
Do you have high b6?
"I'm trying the protein route. The b1 offset is interesting, I may try that out of desperation since my levels seem to be rising and my Neuro issues continue. I just wish I had a better PCP/GP that cared about this. She brushed my high levels off stating many people test high with b6!I appreciate your response."
"Do whatever you can to get them down. I only took b6 100mg for about a month on the advice of a doctor. He said it was very good for nerves, yeah right, it destroyed my nerves in only like 4 weeks and I have never fully healed from it."
"I get frustrated by the lack of advice from doctors or neurologists when it comes to supplements.  I was taking too high a dose of vitamin D (4 pills day) but stopped when I found that out.  I still take vitamin D (two pills now), but ignore anybody who says it is a waste of money.I also wear socks to bed, but usually kick them off before morning."
"I meant 4 pills a day.  And when I found out that too much vitamin D could affect you, I stopped mega-dosing.  I usally buy the Vitamin D3 and only take two of them each morning.  I have too many other drugs and supplements I have to take."
"Yeah the doctor that told me to take, not told me to take, insisted I take a b complex, when I went back and was like all of my issues have been from your stupid b6 vitamin and the whole time you've been telling me to take it for these same issues! I had told him the first week I took them I thought they could be the cause and he said impossible. Not impossible and when I came back with the literature that proved it, he freaked and was like well my attorney will have to handle this. I can't say anything now. ________"
Most doctors are not knowledgeable on supplements and recommend them based on one article or one paragraph they read 30 years ago. Scary actually
"I just found this. Whether it is true, I don't know, but if you do take b1 and it helps, please let me know!See belowHi Thomas,You know a lot about B6, and you've done tons of research. I just wanted to share my experience though, for what it's worth.I started taking vitamins to deal with a thyroid issue. After a few weeks on a B-50 complex, I noticed my toes were burning sometimes. Some research led to a lot of scary stories about B6 toxicity. All my symptoms matched so I immediately stopped the supplements. My burning toes and tingling finger symptoms didn't really go away. I read it can take a while. So I was patient. I didn't avoid B6, but I didn't take B6 either. I took all the B-vitamins separately so I didn't get any B6 that way.After a trip abroad and a few days with not much sleep, I developed a sore burning tongue! The zapping in my feet got worse. A few times at night my entire leg hurt. My arms were going numb completely at night sometimes.I was taking every vitamin except B6. B6 deficiency can cause a sore tongue. So I started to question the B6 thing. The tongue thing got worse and worse, so I was desperate to fix it. I started with small amounts of B6, and immediately felt better. I felt much happier! But at the same time, i noticed more burning and zapping in my toes and fingers.It's a long story but eventually I figured some big things out. Thiamine. Thiamine deficiency will cause nerve pain and muscle pain. Thiamine was the reason for all the zapping in my feet, and the stabbing pains in my legs. I was taking thiamine, so I didn't think it was thiamine. But apparently some people have a transport problem with thiamine and only huge doses will cross the small intestine. It's similar to what some people have with B12.Unlike B6, thiamine is extremely safe and there is no upper limit. It's worth a try for anyone with that burning and tingling toe thing, take thiamine and see if things get better. 200mg of thiamine with each meal for a few days. A large dose is important to compensate for absorption problems, which is usually the cause.After a week of high dose thiamine, my burning toes are gone. After six months.I'm taking B6 as well and feeling so much better. I slowly raised my B6 and found that I actually feel best right now with a B-100 complex (100mg of B6) extended release tablet twice a day. That's 200mg of B6!!! I never even had B6 toxicity.Thiamine deficiency is pretty rare, but can happen in people with thyroid issues, and anything affecting the absorption. Ironically, thiamine deficiency can lead to absorption problems..... sooooo then you just stay thiamine deficient unless you take a ton of thiamine. Also, illness of any kind, pregnancy, lactation, and diarrhea can deplete thiamine stores causing deficiency. Alcohol also uses up thiamine stores.The reason a person will develop burning toes after even a few doses of B6 is that B6 helps get iodine into the thyroid. If the thyroid increases for a few days, thiamine stores can be depleted, leading to thiamine deficiency symptoms.From all I've read and from my experience, B6 supplementation leads to thiamine deficiency. Fix the thiamine deficiency, and it fixes the nerves.BTW, thiamine is needed to get magnesium into cells."
"You symptoms are not unusual, and yes, the loss of sensation you describe is also quite common."
Thank you! It's all very new and I think I was just worried because numerous people said with MS it tended to affect one side not mirror symptoms on both sides
"It sounds like a relapse to me, which I think someone else suggested. I had both feet lose sensation and feel cold no matter what I wore - thermal socks, fleece lined boots, etc - and it lasted for about a month. A friend of mine with MS permanently has no sensation in either of her feet. Yes, often only one side is affected, but it all depends on which nerves are involved. I have found that treatment from a good osteopath and a good acupuncturist can speed up recovery time. Hope this helps. I know it is unpleasant and scary when these flare ups happen."
Thank you so much this is what I have exactly! I hope yours has gone? Did the thermal socks help?
"Hi Emma, no the thermal socks didn't help, but fortunately it went away after about 3 weeks.  Prior to that my relapses were all localised to my left side - I would get numbness that started under my bust and went right down to my toes.  Then I had the ""cold"" feet thing.  I've also had optic neuritis and a horrible relapse that made me lose my balance and at the same time I had numbness across the right side of my face and down my right arm.  That one left permanent damage; I have some loss of sensation in my right hand that gets worse if I'm tired or stressed.  I take pregabalin (Lyrica) for that, and it does help.  I also get some tremor, and have been known to throw a cup of coffee over the bed when my hand just twitched! My worst and most frustrating symptom is fatigue.  I have to pace myself very carefully, and can wake up tired even after doing nothing and having a good night's sleep.  All of this led to me retiring 3 years ago as I just couldn't manage to do my job.  I've since discovered my creative side.  I've just started an HND in Fashion & Textiles.  I have all my fingers and toes crossed that I'll stay well enough to complete it."
Wow so much of what you describe sounds familiar but not the face paralysis I take Lyrica as I have very bad tingles and tremors in my right hand and water (hot water) seems to make it much much worse - I think it's wonderful about your HND! I started colouring last year to help keep my fingers active I hope you keep going with that and the fatigue doesn't get too much to handle whilst doing that. I've had damage since ON last year and slight loss of vision in one eye but as much as this disease is horrible I think keeping your brain busy i.e. Your HND helps hugely
Have you had an x-ray or MRI of lower spine? I also had some numbness/weakness in the legs and it turned out I had a bulging disc in the s1-l5 area.
That sounds painful! I'm having an MRI on my lower spine soon - hope you've had some relief?
When are you going to just accept that you have MS?Ê You have had multiple dx's.
I'm not disputing I was dx with MS I just didn't think it was common to have mirror symptoms in both feet and both legs!
"LibraDragon64 had a better answer than mine, but remember your question began with ""wrong diagnosis""."
That's a rude answer. Lots of people are misdiagnosed. She is intelligent for questioning it and wanting to be sure. Only a fool takes a doctor's word for something without learning about it thoroughly for themselves.
"I do not agree. I wrote to her saying I thought another answer on the board made more sense; she could have revised her post; but no, she reacted angrily to me."
I wasn't reacting angrily but I do apologise if it came across that way that was not my intention at all - I do agree I should have probably not put that title as it's misleading - I'm very new to this forum and MS so do apologise if I appeared to be antagonistic
"Hi everyone thank you all so much for taking the time to reply! I should have probably not posted ""wrong diagnosis"" as the title as I seem to have created issues! MS is very new to me and can be quite scary so I apologise profusely if I upset anyone that was not my intention at all - I don't know how to edit the post to change title but thank you all for your commentsEmma"
"I am sorry, too.  I have had difficulties with this forum, in the past.  I use another forum PLM, and have wrote in there since 2011 (I follow a lot of the other relapsing-remitting MS patients on that site).  I received my dx in Nov 1999, but believe MS started to show up back in 1989, the year I got married.  I was getting so many notices from patient on this website every day, but was planning on unsubscribing if the posts kept on being vague and wide-ranging symptoms and people wondering if it was something else.  I know people with MS can have other problems, but it was stressful reading since people with RRMS can also move to progressive kinds, too.  I did back in 2003. I now walk with a cane. And 5 years ago I started using a walker."
It's definitely frustrating especially when I posted a vague title!! I understand what your saying I've been diagnosed with so many different things before they settled on MS so I think I second guess it sometimes! I currently walk with crutches since this latest setback my brother has MS and he's really not had many issues at all so I think I based it on that too! I hope the walker helps because I find crutches quite difficult?
"No, actually I don't think I would like crutches.  They look they hurt you under the arms.  I am quite a heavy person, too. So, I definitely prefer the walker.  Anyway, thanks for replying."
